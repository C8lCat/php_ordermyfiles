---+++ Order my files +++--------
---------------------------------
not yet another first php-project
---------------------------------

pretty simple:

- get an integrated development environment (WAMP, LAMP, whatever)
- create a folder "to_order"
- paste your files you want to order in it
- execute order.php with your favourite browser
- click on button "order!"
- if there isn't a folder with the name "ordered" there will be one
- the browser shows you your files and in which folder they now are
- switch to folder "ordered" - here are your ordered files

- to modify which files are in which folder, check the code and comments in order.php


have fun!
